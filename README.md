Using the site is relatively straightforward.

In order to create a Graphic Novel you need two things;
- A .mp4 video file
- A .srt subtitle file that corresponds to the video

Once you have these, simply upload each of them by using their respective boxes on the home page. Then once you press go you will be taken to a page where you can view the Graphic Novel Generated.
